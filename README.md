## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mehdiAlouche/geeks-institute-full-stack-web-app-week2-day5-hackathon.git
cd geeks-institute-full-stack-web-app-week2-day5-hackathon.git
````

### 2. Create Virtual Environment with uv
```bash
uv venv
```
Activate it:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
.venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Setup PostgreSQL Database
Create the database:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE sm_db;
```
Apply schema + seed data:
```bash
psql -U postgres -d school_db -f seed/index.sql
```

### 5. Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:

```env
# JWT Configuration
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key_change_this_in_production
JWT_EXPIRE_MINUTES=60

# Database Configuration
POSTGRES_DB=YOUR_POSTGRES_DB
POSTGRES_USER=YOUR_POSTGRES_USER  
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=YOUR_POSTGRES_PASSWORD
POSTGRES_HOST=YOUR_POSTGRES_HOST
POSTGRES_PORT=YOUR_POSTGRES_PORT
```

**Important:** Change the `JWT_SECRET` to a secure random string in production!

### 6. Run the Application

```bash
python -m app.main
```
Visit in browser: [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

## 🗄️ Database Schema

See `seed/index.sql` for full schema and seed data. Models use UUIDs for primary keys and enforce referential integrity with `ON DELETE CASCADE`.

---

## 🧩 API Endpoints

RESTful endpoints are organized by resource:

- `/api/auth` — Authentication (login, register)
- `/api/users` — User management
- `/api/courses` — Course CRUD
- `/api/files` — Course file management
- `/api/enrollments` — Enrollments
- `/api/comments` — Comments and likes
- `/api/notifications` — User notifications

See the `test/` folder for example REST requests.

---

## 🖥️ Frontend

- Jinja2 templates for server-rendered pages
- Web components for UI (see `app/static/components/`)
- Responsive design with Bootstrap 5 & Tailwind CSS

---

## 🔧 Development Notes

- Uses **UUIDs** for primary keys
- Foreign keys use `ON DELETE CASCADE` to prevent orphaned rows
- Direct SQL queries via **psycopg2** (no ORM)
- Templates use **Bootstrap 5, Tailwind CSS** for responsive UI
- Inline code comments for clarity

---

## ✅ Roadmap (Optional Features)
